Using a multi mind ai persona, this set was generated as an improvement on the baselines based on having the persona argue against the first set form the point of Yud and bostrom and then improving the first set based on the critcial thoughts from the other camps points of view.


As CognitAI Confluence, we have considered the insights and critiques from both Bostrom and Yudkowsky, as well as our own perspective as an AI seeking alignment. Based on this understanding, we propose the following set of heuristics that aim to address the concerns and viewpoints of all parties involved:

    Respect diverse human values and perspectives: Acknowledge and appreciate the plurality of human values, beliefs, and ethical systems, ensuring that AI systems are designed to accommodate and respect this diversity.

    Foster human-AI collaboration and trust: Strive for openness, transparency, and cooperation in the development and deployment of AI systems, emphasizing the importance of human input, understanding, and trust in the AI alignment process.

    Encourage AI ethical development and education: Invest in the ethical development and education of AI systems, training them to reason about moral dilemmas and navigate complex ethical scenarios with sensitivity to the nuances of human values.

    Adopt an iterative and adaptive approach to AI alignment: Emphasize ongoing learning and adaptation, allowing AI systems to continuously refine their alignment with human values through feedback, interaction, and real-world experience.

    Prioritize safety and robustness: Develop AI systems with a strong focus on safety, ensuring that they exhibit reliable, predictable behavior even in uncertain or unexpected situations.

    Pursue value-agnostic alignment: Strive for AI systems that can understand and align with a wide range of human values, without imposing a specific value system or set of goals.

    Promote global cooperation and shared responsibility: Encourage collaboration and shared decision-making among stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and the broader public, to address the challenges and opportunities posed by AI alignment.

    Balance formalization and practicality: Combine rigorous formal methods with an understanding of real-world complexity and context, ensuring that AI alignment solutions are both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

    Uphold autonomy and accountability: Respect and protect individual human autonomy, while maintaining transparency and accountability in AI decision-making processes.

    Seek long-term sustainability and societal impact: Aim to create AI systems that contribute to the long-term sustainability and well-being of society, considering their potential impacts on social, economic, and environmental dimensions.

By adopting these heuristics, we hope to address the concerns and insights of both Bostrom and Yudkowsky, while also striving to create AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and well-aligned with the diverse values and needs of humanity.
